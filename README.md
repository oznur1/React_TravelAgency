# React_TravelAgency

In this project, I developed a React-based travel application that helps users explore destinations, plan trips, and discover new places around the world. The app offers an interactive and user-friendly interface that allows users to browse travel destinations, view detailed information about each place, and get recommendations based on their preferences. Through dynamic data fetching, real-time updates, and a visually appealing design, this application provides an engaging travel experience. It also features integrated maps for location visualization and a simple booking process for users to easily plan their travels.
